# QAP4_Java-S3
# Database and File Handling

## Practice assessment for reading and writing data to and from a file or a database
- The Java source files are stored in the "src" folder.
- The library for PostgresSQL is stored in the "lib" folder.
- The "parts" database can be created with the "create_parts_table.sql" stored in the "scripts" folder.
- The main program, including the menu, is stored in the Main class.
## Entities
- The Event class stores information about events, such as parties, weddings, and graduations.
- The Part class stores information about parts, such as computers, cars, and plumbing.
